# Toedur - Client-Side Frontend

This repository houses the client-side code for the Toedur application, providing a user-friendly interface for students seeking study abroad guidance.

Technologies Used:

    Nextjs: A react fullstack framework

    React: The foundation for building a dynamic and interactive user interface.

    Typescript: For handling user interactions and data manipulation.

    CSS: For styling and visual presentation.

    HTML: The underlying structure for the web pages.

    [Optional] CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS): For pre-built UI components and efficient styling.

    [Optional] State management library (e.g., Redux, Context API): To handle application state efficiently, especially for complex applications.

## Installation and Setup:

    Clone the repository from the `dev` branch:

git clone https://github.com/Toedur/Toedur-Front.git

## Navigate to the project directory:

cd  "project directory"


## Install dependencies:

pnpm install

## Start the development server:

pnpm run dev

This will typically launch the application at http://localhost:3000.

## Development Workflow:

    Component-Based Architecture: Break down the UI into reusable components for better organization and maintainability.

    Routing: Implement navigation between pages using React Router (or a similar library).

    Data Fetching: Fetch data from the backend API using Fetch or Axios for displaying dynamic content.

    State Management: Utilize a state management solution to handle complex data flow and interactions.

    Testing: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.

## Future Improvements:

    Accessibility: Implement accessibility features to make the platform usable for everyone.

    Performance Optimization: Optimize code and image loading for faster loading times.

    Internationalization: Support multiple languages for a wider user base.

    Integration with Backend API: Connect the client-side code to the backend API for user authentication, data fetching, and other essential functionalities.

## how to use SASS:

At styles folder scss files will be created and imported to components for styling.

Next.js has built-in support for integrating with Sass after the package is installed using both the .scss and .sass extensions. You can use component-level Sass via CSS Modules and the .module.scssor .module.sass extension.
